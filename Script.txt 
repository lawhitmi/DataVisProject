1. a little introduction of nasa and the dataset
2. ed Graph No.1 "How many number of flights per year"

	talk about the missions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NASA_missions#Robotic_missions 
	
	NASA has successfully launched over 200 crewed flights. Two have ended in failure, causing the death of the entire crew: STS-51-L (the Challenger disaster) in 1986, and STS-107 (the Columbia disaster) in 2003. (Apollo 1 in 1967 lost three crew members but never launched.)

	So many flights so i decided to compare the flying hours with the walking hours  

3. ed Graph No.2 "How many hours they spend flying in space compare to the walking hours in space"  

	and see the year with the most hours flying

4. ed Graph No.3 "How many hours they spend flying in space"

	after reading a little bit of nasa history we found the first woman in nasa:

	1980s

	Sally Ride, America's first woman astronaut
	On June 18, 1983, Sally Ride made history as the first American woman astronaut to go into space.[4] About more than a year later, Judith Resnik took the Space Shuttle Discovery into space and became the second American woman in space.[1][4] In 1988, Ellen Ochoa joined NASA and became the first Hispanic woman astronaut.[8] Ochoa took on multiple missions that included Space shuttles Discovery, Atlantis, four flights, and almost 1,000 hours in space. In 1985, Shannon Lucid took on her first flight and by the end of her career she had spent 188 days in space.[1] Lucid set an American record, for both men and women, with the most number of days in space until 2002.[1]

	1990s
	By the 1990s, NASA was doing a lot of research in women's bodies and the effects of space to their bodies. Carolyn Huntoon gave a speech in 1994 at the 2nd Annual Women's Health and Space Luncheon by giving light to the unrecognized work of NASA.[1] On February 3, 1995, history was made when Colonel Eileen Collins became the first woman to pilot a spacecraft.[4] Meanwhile, Shannon Lucid, a board engineer, took on five missions in space and worked as chief scientist for NASA in Washington, DC.[4]

5. ed Graph No.4 "How is the proportion of women spending space flying hours comparing to male" 

	I think this is a good introduction so can talk about the inclusion of female in nasa.

6. Federico Let´s start with the proportion of male/female NASA astronauts from 1959 to 2013

7. Federico What about the gender distribution of US astronauts from 1959-2013?

8. Federico Which are the US regions with more female astronauts?

9. Federico What about the age at time of NASA’s selection? --> i think this graph can be use more by lucas that is trying to explain the path of an astronaut OR move it 		to position 10 so you can introduce the next "issue"

10. Federico Which is the program with more female astronauts' participation?

11. Lucas Path of the astronaut
